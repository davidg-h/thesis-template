\chapter{Research Questions and Scope}\label{ch:research-topic}

The aim of this thesis is to investigate how latent spaces in generative diffusion models can be systematically explored and navigated using different methods, and to analyse the limits of interpretability and controllability from a perceptual perspective.

The work focuses on the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To what extent can latent spaces in generative diffusion models be systematically explored through interpolation and targeted navigation without modifying the underlying model?
    \item Which structural and perceptual patterns emerge during latent space navigation, and where do discontinuities or instabilities occur?
    \item What are the limits of interpretability and controllability of latent spaces (when evaluated through human perception)?
\end{itemize}
