\begin{itemize}
    \item Existing approaches to latent space analysis.
    \item Methods for latent space visualization and exploration.
    \item Control and navigation techniques in generative diffusion models.
    \item Limitations of current evaluation strategies.

In this chapter, we're actually using some code!

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,caption={This is an example of inline listing},captionpos=b]
x = 1
if x == 1:
    # indented four spaces
    print("x is 1.")

\end{lstlisting}

You can also include listings from a file directly:

\lstinputlisting[language=Python,caption={This is an example of included listing},captionpos=b]{listings/example.py}
