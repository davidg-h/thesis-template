  abstract       = {Modern society is increasingly permeated by realities parallel to the real one. The so-called virtual reality is now part of both current habits and many activities carried out during the day. Virtual reality (VR) is, in turn, related to the concept of augmented reality (AR). It represents a technology still in solid expansion but which was created and imagined several decades ago. This paper presents an overview of augmented reality, starting from its conception, passing through its main applications, and providing essential information. Part of the article will be devoted to hardware and software components used in AR systems. The last part of the paper highlights the limitations related to the design of these systems, the shortcomings in this area, and the possible future fields of application of this extraordinary technological innovation.},
